# Short Answer Questions

### 1.  Explain the causes of urbanization in 19th century Europe.
- Food supply was strong, and industry
  flourished in the Second Industrial
  Revolution. As a result, cities had
  plenty of food and jobs, so people
  moved to them.

### 2.  Explain Karl Marx's statement "The communists support all revolutions everywhere".
- The Marxist worldview is
  fundamentally based on the concept of
  "class struggle."
- The Communists belive that the current
  ruling class, the bourgeoise, are
  oppressing the proletariat.
- The Communists want the proletariat to
  be the ruling, and the only, class.
  Additionally, they want to destabilize
  any country that is not under the
  control of the proletariat.
- Because any revolution at this time
  would involve the proletariat fighting
  against the bourgeoise, the Communists
  "support all revolutions everywhere."

### 3.  Explain why Germany was blamed for World War I and assess the arguments for and against this conclusion.
- Germany certainly contributed to the
  escalation of the war when, in order
  to launch a preemptive strike on
  France, they began an unprovoked
  invasion of Belgium.
- However, they do
  not deserve full blame for the war,
  since Austria-Hungary was already at
  war with Serbia and Russia at that
  point.

### 4.  Compare and contrast fascism and communism.
- Fascism is militaristic and
  nationalistic/racist, and not especially
  socialist, except when it's
  convenient. They aren't capitalists
  either because they like to control
  the market, so no "free market."
  Fascists want to create/restore
  empires, and to prove that their nation
  is better than the others.
- Communism as a form of authoritarian
  government is less obsessed with race,
  and more obsessed with class. The
  Communists
  want to spread throughout the world,
  but by revolution, not invasion.

### 5.  Explain the popularity of non-democratic governments in the 1920s and 1930s in Europe.
- Democracy was really a new thing at
  this point, for Europe at least. The
  people still remembered their
  monarchical past.
- They wanted leaders who would take
  them out of their economic depression.
- Because of the high degree of
  political instability, people wanted a
  form of government that they viewed as
  more stable.

### 6.  Explain the causes of the Cold War following WWII.
- Western and Russian forces came in to
  contact in occupied Germany, and
  Soviet efforts to patch the hole in
  the Iron Curtain that West Berlin
  represented did not help.
- The USSR wanted to spread Communism
  throught the world, and the USA wanted
  to stop them.

### 7.  Explain the causes of the collapse of the iron curtain and Soviet Union.
- The Polish Communist government was
  forced to let JP2 in---he openly
  defied the government by holding Mass,
  and the Solidary movement started
  soon after.
- Dissident movements appeared,
  appealing to the Helinski accords as
  their legal basis.
- Chad Mikhail Gorbachev didn't try to
  crack down super hard; instead he
  made the government less authoritarian
  and more democratic.
- Soon, some Soviet nations began to
  take down their walls, and when a
  crowd in Berlin took down the Berlin
  Wall, the guards did not stop them.
- Finally, Russia voted to leave the
  Soviet Union, and the Cold War was
  over.
